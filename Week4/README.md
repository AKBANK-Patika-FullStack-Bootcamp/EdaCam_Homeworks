## Week 4
- The Web API, which used to operate with static data, has been made dynamic by providing a connection to the MSSQL database.
- CRUD operations with dynamic data are performed with the **ProductContext** object and the methods used over the database tables obtained from the Entity layer.
- The **DBOperations** class is created to establish the communication between the Service layer and the Entity layer.
